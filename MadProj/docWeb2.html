      <h2>Service-Oriented Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a style of software design where services are provided to
        the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.
        Its principles are independent of vendors and other technologies. In service oriented architecture,
        a number of services communicate with each other, in one of two ways: through passing data or
        through two or more services coordinating an activity.

          <h4><strong>DNS</strong></h4>
          <p>
            DNS stands for “Domain Name System” and it’s a backbone technology that makes the world
            wide web possible. At the most basic level DNS provides a key/value lookup from a domain
            name (e.g., google.com) to an IP address (e.g., 85.129.83.120), which is required in order
            for your computer to route a request to the appropriate server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Analogizing to phone numbers, the difference between a domain name and IP address is the
            difference between “call John Doe” and “call 201-867–5309.” Just like you needed a phone
            book to look up John’s number in the old days, you need DNS to look up the IP address for
            a domain. So you can think of DNS as the phone book for the internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our site we have chosen as domain name: <strong>www.medical-awesome.com</strong>

          <h4><strong>Load Balancer</strong></h4>
          <p>
            They’re the magic sauce that makes scaling horizontally possible. <i>Horizontal scaling</i>
            means that you scale by adding more machines into your pool of resources (Vertical scaling
            means that you scale by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine). In web
            development, you (almost) always want to scale horizontally because, to keep it simple,
            stuff breaks. Servers crash randomly. Networks degrade. Entire data centers occasionally
            go offline. Having more than one server allows you to plan for outages so that your
            application continues running. In other words, your app is “fault tolerant.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, horizontal scaling allows you to minimally couple different parts of your
            application backend (web server, database, service X, etc.) by having each of them run
            on different servers. Lastly, you may reach a scale where it’s not possible to vertically
            scale any more. There is no computer in the world big enough to do all your app’s computations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Load balancers route incoming requests to one of many application servers that are typically
            clones / mirror images of each other and send the response from the app server back to the
            client. Any one of them should process the request the same way so it’s just a matter of
            distributing the requests across the set of servers so none of them are overloaded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Load balancing improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources,
            such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk
            drives. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize
            response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Using multiple components with
            load balancing instead of a single component may increase reliability and availability
            through redundancy. Load balancing usually involves dedicated software or hardware, such
            as a multilayer switch or a Domain Name System server process.

          <h4><strong>Web Application Servers</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Web application servers execute the core business logic that handles a user’s request
            and sends back HTML to the user’s browser. To do their job, they typically communicate
            with a variety of backend infrastructure such as databases, caching layers, job queues,
            search services, other microservices, data/logging queues, and more. As mentioned above,
            you typically have at least two and often times many more, plugged into a load balancer
            in order to process user requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            App server implementations require choosing a specific language and for ous site we choose
            <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro-whatis.php" target="_blank">PHP</a> and a web
            MVC framework for that language <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>.

          <h4><b>Database Servers</b></h4>
          <p>
            Databases provide ways of defining your data structures, inserting new data, finding existing
            data, updating or deleting existing data, performing computations across the data, and more.
            In most cases the web app servers talk directly to one, as will the job servers. Additionally,
            each backend service may have it’s own database that’s isolated from the rest of the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            For our project we choose as data Apache2 and two open-source relational database management

          <h4><strong>Caching Service</strong></h4>
          <p>
            A caching service provides a simple key/value data store that makes it possible to save and lookup
            information in close to O(1) time. Applications typically leverage caching services to save the
            results of expensive computations so that it’s possible to retrieve the results from the cache
            instead of recomputing them the next time they’re needed. An application might cache results
            from a database query, calls to external services, HTML for a given URL, and many more. Here are
            some examples from real world applications:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google caches search results for common search queries like “dog” rather than re-computing
                them each time</li>
              <li>Facebook caches much of the data you see when you log in, such as post data, friends, etc.</li>
              <li>MAD caches the HTML output from server-side <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html" target="_blank">React rendering</a>, search results, typeahead
                results, and more. More about <a href="https://css-tricks.com/render-caching-for-react/" target="_blank">Render Caching for React</a></li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Server Side Rendering</i> (SSR) is a very useful technique that makes web apps appear faster. The
            initial HTML is displayed before the JavaScript is parsed and, while the user is deciding what
            to tap on, our handlers are ready.
            Server side rendering in React requires additional work to setup and has server costs. Furthermore,
            if your server team cannot have JavaScript running on your servers, you are stuck. It significantly
            complicates the <a href="#cdn">CDN</a> setup especially if you have pages that require login and where the user’s
            information is managed.
          </p>
          <p>
            
            We use one of the most widespread caching server technologie <a href="https://redis.io/" target="_blank">Redis</a>.

        <section id="job">
          <!-- review? -->
          <h4><strong>Job Queue & Servers</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Most web applications need to do some work asynchronously behind the scenes that’s not directly
            associated with responding to a user’s request. For instance, Google needs to crawl and index
            the entire internet in order to return search results. It does not do this every time you search.
            Instead, it crawls the web asynchronously, updating the search indexes along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            While there are different architectures that enable asynchronous work to be done, the most
            ubiquitous is what I’ll call the “job queue” architecture. It consists of two components: a queue
            of “jobs” that need to be run and one or more job servers (often called “workers”) that run the
            jobs in the queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Job queues store a list of jobs that need to be run asynchronously. The simplest are
            first-in-first-out (FIFO) queues though most applications end up needing some sort of priority
            queuing system. Whenever the app needs a job to be run, either on some sort of regular schedule
            or as determined by user actions, it simply adds the appropriate job to the queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>MAD</i>, for instance, leverages a job queue to power a lot of the behind-the-scenes work
            required to support our marketplaces. We run jobs to encode videos and photos, process CSVs
            for metadata tagging, aggregate user statistics, send password reset emails, and more. We
            started with a simple FIFO queue though we upgraded to a priority queue to ensure that
            time-sensitive operations like sending password reset emails were completed ASAP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Job servers process jobs. They poll the job queue to determine if there’s work to do and if
            there is, they pop a job off the queue and execute it. <a href="https://geekflare.com/queuing-systems-for-backend-developers/" target="_blank">Redis</a>

          <h4><strong>Full-text Search Service</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Many if not most web apps support some sort of search feature where a user provides a text
            input (often called a “query”) and the app returns the most “relevant” results. The technology
            powering this functionality is typically referred to as “full-text search”, which leverages
            an inverted index to quickly look up documents that contain the query keywords.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s possible to do full-text search directly from MySQL because it supports
            full-text search.

          <h4><strong>Services</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Once an app reaches a certain scale, there will likely be certain “services” that are carved
            out to run as separate applications. They’re not exposed to the external world but the app and
            other services interact with them. MAD, for example, has several operational and planned
            services:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Account service stores user data across all our sites, which allows us to easily offer
                relevant information and create a more unified user experience</li>
              <li>Content service stores metadata for all of our video, audio, and image content. It also
                provides interfaces for downloading the content and viewing download history.</li>
              <li>HTML → PDF service provides a simple interface that accepts HTML and returns a
                corresponding PDF document.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="data">
          <!-- review? -->
          <h4><strong>Data</strong></h4>
          <p>
            Today, companies live and die based on how well they harness data. Almost every app these
            days, once it reaches a certain scale, leverages a data pipeline to ensure that data can be
            collected, stored, and analyzed. A typical pipeline has three main stages:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The app sends data, typically events about user interactions, to the data “firehose” which
                provides a streaming interface to ingest and process the data. Often times the raw data is
                transformed or augmented and passed to another firehose. AWS Kinesis is one of the
                most common technologies for this purpose.
              </li>
              <li>
                The raw data as well as the final transformed/augmented data are saved to cloud storage.
                AWS Kinesis provides a setting called “firehose” that makes saving the raw data to it’s
                cloud storage extremely easy to configure.
              </li>
              <li>
                The transformed/augmented data is often loaded into a data warehouse for analysis. We
                use AWS Redshift, as does a large and growing portion of the startup world, though larger
                companies will often use Oracle or other proprietary warehouse technologies.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another step that’s not pictured in the architecture diagram: loading data from the app
            and services’ operational databases into the data warehouse. For example at MAD
            we load our VideoBlocks, AudioBlocks, Storyblocks, account service, and contributor portal
            databases into Redshift every night. This provides our analysts a holistic dataset by
            co-locating the core business data alongside our user interaction event data.

            according to <a href="Full-text Search Service" target="_blank">AWS</a>. You can use it to store and access more or less anything you’d store on a
            local file system with the benefits of being able to interact with it via a RESTful API over
            HTTP. Amazon’s S3 offering is by far the most popular cloud storage available today and the
            one we rely on extensively here at MAD to store our video, photo, and audio assets,
            our CSS and Javascript, our user event data and much more.

          <h4><strong>CDN</strong></h4>
          <p>
            CDN stands for “Content Delivery Network” and the technology provides a way of serving
            assets such as static HTML, CSS, Javascript, and images over the web much faster than
            serving them from a single origin server. It works by distributing the content across
            many “edge” servers around the world so that users end up downloading assets from the
            “edge” servers instead of the origin server. For instance a user in
            Spain requests a web page from a site with origin servers in NYC, but the static assets
            for the page are loaded from a CDN “edge” server in England, preventing many slow
            cross-Atlantic HTTP requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general a web app should always use a CDN to serve CSS, Javascript, images, videos
            and any other assets, that is why for our site we used <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/" target="_blank">Cloudflare CDN</a>.

          <h3>External Data Sources</h3>
          <p>
            For data about diseases and other medical conditions, we get the necessary information from
            <a href="https://medisys.newsbrief.eu/medisys/homeedition/en/home.html" target="_blank">MediSys</a>, <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/data/" target="_blank">Gapminder World</a>. For countries informations, such as population and cultural factors we get the information from
            <a href="https://www.hofstede-insights.com/product/compare-countries/" target="_blank">Hofstede Insights</a> and simply
            searching on Google.

          <h3>External services - APIs</h3>
          <p>
            An application programming interface (API) is an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer
            program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software.
          </p>
          <strong>APIs for map</strong>
          <p>
            Geolocation API - Find a location and accuracy radius based on information from things like cell towers and WiFi access points that a mobile client can detect
            with the Geolocation API. This is primarily used where GPS is not possible or appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Maps Static API - Place a Google Maps image on your webpage without requiring JavaScript or any dynamic page loading with the Maps Static API. This service
            creates your map based on URL parameters sent through a standard HTTP request and returns the map as an image.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geocoding API - Convert addresses into geographic coordinates (geocoding), which you can use to place markers or position the map. This API also allows you
            to convert geographic coordinates into an address (reverse geocoding).
          </p>
          <p>
            Maps JavaScript API - Add a map to your website, providing imagery and local data from the same source as Google Maps. Style the map to suit your needs.
            Visualize your own data on the map, bring the world to life with Street View, and use services like geocoding and directions.

        <h2>User guide</h2>
        <p>
          A user guide, also commonly called a technical communication document or manual,
          is intended to give assistance to people using a particular system.

            <li>recorded(student) - is the user which has an account, can ask questions but can't answer them</li>
            <li>scientist - is the user with an account (scientist = true), can ask questions and answer them
            (usualy the scientists are for answering, not to ask questions, but they can do that)</li>
          </ol>

            The visitor user is the only type of user that doesn't have to login. He can see all the data about
            any medical condition or anything else but can't contribute with articles, answer or ask questions.
